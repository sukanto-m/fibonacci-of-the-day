## ðŸŒ€ What It Does

* **Fetches a new image daily** from Unsplash based on Fibonacci-related queries
* Uses **GPT-4** to generate short captions explaining the pattern
* Displays **photographer credit** and image source
* Lets users **download or share** the image
* Tracks a **timeline** of past images and captions

---

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

### Frontend

* React + Vite
* Tailwind CSS
* Vercel (for hosting)

### Backend

* FastAPI (Python)
* Unsplash API for images
* OpenAI GPT-4o for captions
* JSON-based timeline storage
* Render (for hosting backend)

---

## ðŸ“¸ Credits & Ethics

* All images are served via the **Unsplash API** and credited to the photographer
* Captions are generated via **OpenAI GPT-4o** based on image metadata (not visual recognition)

## ðŸ’¡ Future Ideas

* Let users browse full timeline or specific dates
* Add educational overlays (spiral tracing, math notes)
* Add PWA support or mobile app wrapper
* Optionally use GPT-4 vision to caption real images
